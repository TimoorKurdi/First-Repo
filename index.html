		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<h3 id="date">5/30/14</h3>
			<p>Hey all! Timoor Kurdi here, rookie and newby to the world of programming. I first got involved in software when I was at my previous job as a Banker, I was using various software programs to conduct wire transfers and approve currency exchanges when I was realized I was more drawn to the process that helped bring about these transactions than the actual transactions themselves. Living in a digital age, I want a seat at the dinner table, I am eager to learn as much as I can and I enjoy building things, more importantly I love the journey and the process which even as a noob I quicly realized is essential in software development because a lot of being a dev is figuring out what's wrong and trying to fix it and make it run smoothly. I want to have a well rounded knowledge base and love emerging technologies that can change the game in a single minute, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't partial to Ruby as a favorite, I just love the beginner friendly syntax and agile development environment. I look forward to this journey and meeting some cool people along the way! </p>
		<h2>Post-Bank/Pre-Dev</h2>
			<p>In my free time since I quit my job at the Bank, I have been using online tutorials to learn as much as I can, codecademy, learnstreet, rubymonk, Learn to Program by Chris Pine are few of the resources I've looked over and studied. In my experience, I've found that no one single method is the best way to write code, especially in Ruby there are many ways to write and refactor and repeat that process. I've tried to take snippets from each source I've read to have a basic understanding and now am looking to take the next step in advancing my understanding of development. It's very easy to get frustrated on your own and I've definitely had those moments especially when I looked over Michael Hartl's tutorial, a fantastic source but a bit of stretch for me at the moment, I definitely want to finish it eventually and attend meet-ups to code collaboratively.</p>
		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
			<p>In my free time, I enjoy working out and am currently on the quest to find the best Burger in NYC! I also enjoy listening to classic rock and watching hockey. I'm always looking to connect with people at my level and more experienced, we can all learn from each other and have unique ideas and perspectives, software is definitely a team sport, feel free to drop me a line with the links provided below. Thank you for reading!</p>
